Toxic Comment Classification<br>
Apr 2019 - May 2019<br>
Classifying toxic comments from the internet into 6 classes as multilabels and calculating the probablity for each class. It's an old Kaggle competition problem. Achieved accuracy of 98% appx on dev set . While accuracy on Kaggle was 91.2%.<hr>
Poetry Generation<br>
Apr 2019 - Present<br>
Generating poetry using encoder and decoder RNN model(seq2seq).<hr>
News Article Summarization<br>
Jun 2019 - Present<br>
Using abstractive and extractive methods to summarize a given news article in four to five sentences by applying machine learning and deep learning techniques.<hr>
Hand-Written-Digit Recognition<br>
Mar 2019 - Present<br>
Using Deep Neural Network to recognize the hand written digits. The data is a part of the MNIST data and was available on Kaggle as a part of competition.<br>
Accuracy obtained on Kaggle = 97.328<br>
Accuracy on own test set = 98.8<hr>
Classification of text files and extracting specific features from them.<br>
Mar 2019 - Present<br>
This is based on an assignment from DBS Partners. Using Natural Language Processing to classify text files into two classes .Furthermore extracting specified features from those text files . So, far part 1 is completed with accuracy of 90.01%.
